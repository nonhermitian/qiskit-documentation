# Introduction

Since IBM put the first quantum computer on the cloud in 2016, the field of quantum computing has been largely focused small-scale experiments looking at foundational elements of qunantum information science.  However, recent advances in both quantum hardware and software have caused a disruptive change, where it is now possible to utilize a quantum computer for conducting experiments outside of direct classical validation.  With demonstations of quantum utility now in hand, quantum computing has opened up to a new class of user, the Quantum Computational Scientist, who can now utilize quantum tools for experiments in domains outside of quantum computation itself.

Through IBM Quantum, you have access to performant quantum software (Qiskit) and utility-scale, 100+ qubit quantum systems for performming experiments in this new regime. Whether you try out a no-cost plan or run your programs through a pay-as-you-go or premium plan, you can start doing useful work with quantum computing now.

The sections at the core of our documentation are based on the four steps involved in composing a quantum algorithm or application: 1) Build quantum circuits and operators, either directly, or from classical inputs. 2) Translate quantum circuits and operators for execution on a quantum device. 3) Execute on quantum hardware (or a simulator) using Qiskit Primitives.  And finally, 4) post-processing of results. Together, these steps form a **Qiskit Pattern**.
 
If youâ€™re just getting started with IBM Quantum, you are in the right place. Use the topics in this section to get ready, then proceed to [Build](../build) to create your first quantum circuit and operators. Keep working through the sections in order, following the tabs at the top of this page.

## Installation

Need to install the necessary tools?

- [Install](install): Begin using our tools and platforms with install and setup instructions.

## Documentation sections

- [Build](../build): Design and develop quantum circuits with primitives and advanced methods like dynamic circuits and mid-circuit measurements. You can also find our circuit library here.
