# Introduction

The first step in any quantum algorithm or application involves constructing quantum circuits, and often quantum operators, that represent the problem you are solving. Quantum circuits, which consist of operations - including gates, measurement, and reset - that manipulate qubits in the quantum computer, and encodes the problem.  Quantum operators, describe physical systems, and are the observables whose values one wants to know.  Quantum operators are often also used to construct quantum circuits from the interations amongst qubits that they describe. Depending on your needs, you can use Qiskit or OpenQASM to create your circuits. 

Qiskit enables working with circuits (and, to some extent, operators) at various abstraction levels: abstract, virtual, physical, scheduled, and pulse programs. At the most abstract level is a task-oriented lens in the [circuit library](circuit-library). You can also express operations in abstract mathematical terms using operators, isometries, and classical/Boolean functions. For virtual circuits, mathematical abstractions take on a concrete representation in terms of a formal gate set. At the physical level, those instructions are mapped to specific physical qubits, and instructions are re-written to reflect the connectivity and native gate set of a target hardware platform. Scheduled circuits introduce timing information, and [pulse programs](pulse) represent signals on channels.

Qiskit and [OpenQASM](introduction-to-qasm) further support the notion of extended circuits, which expand the set of allowed operations to include real-time computations on classical values. Qiskit's tooling for working with this richer family of circuits is found in the section on [Classical feedforward and control flow](classical-feedforward-and-control-flow).
